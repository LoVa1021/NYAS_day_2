# Git Notes

These are my notes on Git.

```
git init
```

This is `inline code`.

<h2> This is an HTML header <h2>

$$f(x) = x^2$$

$f(x) = x^2$

* `git init`: initializes repository 

* `git status` : tells us status of repository


* `git add .` : adds files to repository, can be specifically by file or everything(. which means here)

* `git commit`: dedicate myself to a version -m "" adds message to commit

`q`: to quit

---

### Tracking Changes

* `git diff` : shows me what has changed since you added, if nothing shows up, then you have added most current version, so if you proceed to commit it will be most current version


* `git log` : list of commits that have happened so far, what time, by who with identifier to reference earlier versions

Make a script

 *touch first_script.r

 *open first_script.r
 
R studio comes with built in data and commands

ctrl + enter will run the line of commands
